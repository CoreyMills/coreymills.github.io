							Here are some images from the week-long Game Jam run by Phi Dinh and Niall Taylor (College Lecturers at the time).<br> <br> 
							The project included 9 other students; I was one of two Junior Programmers on the team,
							I wrote code for the gameplay elements and their physics-based effects within the game. ​<br> <br>
							I also modelled some of the 3D Objects seen in the first image (Hammer & Log). ​<br> <br>
							​Created with Unity and 3DS MAX.

							Here is a Game Jam that was run out of the UTC@MediaCityUK college in 2017, the theme being the college. <br> <br>
							I created two small 2D mini-games that played one after the other, The first a parody of Donkey Kong and the second of Pac-Man.
							The enemy characters were based on college lecturers at the time.<br> <br>
							​The first Image shows the Kong Level and the second is a short video of the games being roughly played. 
							Created with Unity.<br> <br>
